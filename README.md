# Git & GitHub Testing with DDA Files

This repository contains all the work made at the Advanced Digital Design (or Dise√±o Digital Avanzado - DDA).
The course is oriented to coding/understanding the FPGA systems and RTL or HDL, using Verilog as the main language.
From the beginning i used to make the coding at the IDE Vivado from AMD, from where its possible to program and route the FPGA.
